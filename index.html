    <h1><strong>Act Now!</strong></h1>
    <p>
      Animals and plants aren’t just valuable for their own sake – they’re
      also part of a wider natural environment that may provide food, shelter,
      water, and other functions, for other wildlife and people.
      <br><br>
      You need to educate your family about endangered species in your area,
      recycle and buy sustainable products and often volunteer to help save
      wildlife or create awareness.
